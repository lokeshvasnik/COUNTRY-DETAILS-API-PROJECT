## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is an application that takes the country name as an input and gives some useful information about the country like the CAPITAL of the country and the continent

Here I have fetched the data from the rest API countries

If we want we can add more useful information but I have kept it simple which will just show the continent and the capital city of the country and also the flag.
Or else we can get information like the current population of the country or the timezone so on and so forth.

I have attached some snap shots do check them out.
